    "# 1. Theoretical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pokémon** is a long-running multimedia franchise developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, centered around capturing, training, and battling fictional creatures called Pokémon. While the franchise began with turn-based RPGs, it has evolved into a global phenomenon encompassing video games, trading cards, television shows, and competitive gaming communities. Within the games themselves, players take on the role of Pokémon Trainers, building teams of creatures with unique abilities, statistics, and move sets in order to battle other trainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive scene, particularly through platforms such as [Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/), battles are conducted using meticulously balanced rulesets curated by the community (notably Smogon University). Players construct teams of six Pokémon chosen from a pool of hundreds, each with distinct roles, strategies, and limitations. Due to this variety, the competitive metagame is both dynamic and complex, requiring players to adapt to frequent shifts in viability and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this complexity, there is currently no single metric that objectively quantifies a Pokémon’s overall viability within a tier. Viability is influenced not only by raw strength but also by factors such as usage trends, versatility, and synergy with other team members. This project proposes a **Meta Viability Index (MVI)**, a composite indicator designed to capture these multidimensional aspects and produce a single score representing a Pokémon’s competitive relevance in a specific tier. This Jupyter Notebook file contains a brief rundown of each section, alongside the accompanying code. A word document will be included to fully delve into aspects of the project that may need more explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification for the Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive viability in Pokémon is a multidimensional concept. It cannot be fully captured by a single attribute like base stats or usage percentage. Instead, a Pokémon’s effectiveness in the metagame is shaped by its consistency, versatility, and how well it synergizes with common team structures. These aspects, though individually measurable, are rarely combined into a single interpretable metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the competitive community, particularly Smogon University, uses tier systems based on both usage statistics and expert discussions to group Pokémon. While effective in practice, these tier lists do not provide a scoring mechanism for comparing Pokémon within a tier or understanding the marginal differences between them. As a result, players often rely on subjective opinions when evaluating Pokémon for their teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite indicators are not new to games. In football video games like *FIFA*, players are scored using overall ratings that aggregate multiple statistics such as speed, stamina, passing, and shooting. Similarly, MOBA titles like League of Legends use matchmaking rating (MMR) and champion win rates as blended indicators to estimate performance and balance. These systems combine variables into a single numerical value to inform gameplay decisions, matchmaking, and tier lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project follows a similar philosophy by introducing a composite indicator to competitive Pokémon. The proposed **Meta Viability Index (MVI)** integrates usage statistics, performance trends, and role flexibility into a unified score. This approach allows for transparent, data-driven comparison of Pokémon and helps capture the complexity of competitive viability in a structured and objective way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data used in this index comes from [Smogon.com](https://www.smogon.com/stats/), which publishes monthly statistics from Pokémon Showdown, an online battle simulator widely used by the competitive community. These statistics are:\n",
    "- **Large-scale** (millions of battles per month),\n",
    "- **Current** (updated monthly),\n",
    "- **Representative** of actual meta usage,\n",
    "- **Structured** and consistent for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As expert interviews or official Pokémon Company data are unavailable, these community-driven sources represent the most authoritative and widely accepted datasets available for this kind of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Meta Viability and Variable Selection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, **meta viability** is defined as a Pokémon’s overall effectiveness, consistency, and strategic value within a competitive tier. It reflects how often a Pokémon is used, how reliably it performs, and how flexibly it fits into a variety of viable team compositions. This concept is inherently multidimensional and must be captured through a combination of different measurable attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure methodological consistency and relevance, the variables selected for the Meta Viability Index (MVI) must meet the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be **publicly available** and consistently measured across all Pokémon in the dataset.\n",
    "- Represent **distinct aspects** of competitive performance to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "- Be **quantifiable** and suitable for standardisation.\n",
    "- Offer **strategic insight** into how and why a Pokémon is effective in its role(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected variables will be grouped into three broad categories to support a balanced evaluation:\n",
    "- **Usage Metrics** (e.g., usage rate, lead frequency)\n",
    "- **Performance Metrics** (e.g., win rate, success over time)\n",
    "- **Flexibility Metrics** (e.g., moveset diversity, role variety)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure will guide the data selection and analysis process in the sections that follow, supporting the creation of a composite indicator that captures the full competitive profile of each Pokémon.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevance to Players and Researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "This index may prove useful to:\n",
    "- **Competitive players** aiming to identify meta threats or reliable team staples.\n",
    "- **Analysts** seeking trends in usage and performance.\n",
    "- **Developers** and community tiering councils looking for data to support bans or suspect tests."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines the process of selecting appropriate indicators for the Meta Viability Index (MVI). All variables were chosen based on their relevance to the concept of meta viability, and availability from credible data sources. Each variable captures a distinct aspect of a Pokémon’s performance in competitive play, as defined in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this project is strictly on Pokémon within a single tier: **Gen 9 OverUsed (OU)**, to ensure fair comparisons and avoid confounding the analysis with the effects of tier-based filtering. The MVI is designed to rank Pokémon within this tier, based on how viable they are relative to Pokémon in the same tier.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Data is sourced from [Smogon.com](https://www.smogon.com/stats/), based on Pokémon Showdown battles, a widely popular, trusted and consistent source.\n",
    "- Available monthly and by tier, making it easy to isolate Gen 9 OU data as well as data of any other tier.\n",
    "- Usage and moveset information is based on real player behavior and reflects current metagame trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- No direct win/loss data or performance outcomes are available.\n",
    "- Moveset and teammate diversity require computation and may be sensitive to parsing accuracy.\n",
    "- Synergy and matchup effectiveness are not directly captured and must be inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases of data scarcity, **proxy variables** were selected to approximate competitive value. For instance, **moveset diversity** is used as a stand-in for overall flexibility, while **lead usage** reflects reliability in a defined role, as the lead role in a team is quite important, those that are used as leads more often are judged to be overall better.\n",

    "# 3. Imputation of Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data can result from Pokémon being used too infrequently to be logged in all Smogon statistical categories, or from structural inconsistencies across the data files. Left unaddressed, these gaps may introduce bias or instability into the composite indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this stage is to ensure that the dataset used for the Meta Viability Index (MVI) is both complete and robust. The imputation strategy includes a combination of filtering and logical defaulting (e.g., setting missing values to 0% where appropriate), as well as removing entries with insufficient information. As Smogon is an extremely reliable source, filtering is the most used method here.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable-Specific Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Percentage & Raw Count\n",
    "All Pokémon in the `usage.txt` file have valid usage statistics, but not all are relevant for inclusion in a competitive analysis. To reduce noise, any Pokémon with a usage percentage below **0.5%** was removed from the dataset. This threshold filters out fringe or gimmick entries and ensures that only Pokémon with meaningful presence in the metagame are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lead Usage Percentage\n",
    "Pokémon not used as leads are often excluded from the `leads.txt` file. For any valid Pokémon from the filtered usage data that do not appear in the leads file, a **lead usage percentage of 0.0%** is imputed. This reflects the fact that they are never used in the lead position, rather than being truly “missing” values. Likewise, any Pokémon that were removed from Usage, will be removed from Leads as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moveset and Teammate Diversity\n",
    "Derived from the `moveset.txt` file, these variables are only available for Pokémon with sufficient representation in battle logs. If a Pokémon from the filtered usage list does not appear in the moveset file, it is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pokémon below 0.5% usage were excluded.\n",
    "- Pokémon with missing lead usage were retained, with lead usage set to 0%.\n",
    "- Pokémon missing moveset or teammate data were excluded to preserve indicator consistency.\n",
    "- No synthetic or model-based imputation was used; all substitutions reflect either logical defaults or established exclusion criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned dataset resulting from this process serves as a stable foundation for the normalisation and aggregation steps that follow."
